django-oembed
=============

Another Django OEmbed application. This one relies on a 
`fork of python-oembed <https://github.com/dokterbob/python-oembed>`_ (which also supports auto-discovery) and has models representing the results of OEmbed queries. It is very simple, which is why it works so well. =)

By now, its functionality might have been superseded by something like 
`djangoembed <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangoembed/>`_ but the current code works and is used in several of our projects.
